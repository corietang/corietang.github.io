					<p>One night I dreamed a dream.<br>As I was walking along the beach with my Lord.<br>Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life.<br>For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand,<br>One belonging to me and one to my Lord.</p>
					<br>
					<p>After the last scene of my life flashed before me,<br>I looked back at the footprints in the sand.<br>I noticed that at many times along the path of my life,<br>especially at the very lowest and saddest times,<br>there was only one set of footprints.</p>
					<br>
					<p>This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it.<br>“Lord, you said once I decided to follow you,<br>You’d walk with me all the way.<br>But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life,<br>there was only one set of footprints.<br>I don’t understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me.”</p>
					<br>
					<p>He whispered, “My precious child, I love you and will never leave you<br>Never, ever, during your trials and testings.<br>When you saw only one set of footprints,<br>It was then that I carried you.”</p>
